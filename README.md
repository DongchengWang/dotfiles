# A collection of useful dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles.

It contains some code style configurations and open-source software files.

I use this list to stay consistent when creating new repositories or using different languages.

## How to adopt

1. clone this repository.
2. copy the dotfiles you need to your own project.
3. enjoy coding.
