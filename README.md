# A collection of useful dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles.

It contains some configuration files for code style configuration and open-source projects.

I use this list to stay consistent when creating new repositories.

## How to adopt

1. clone this repository.
2. copy dotfiles you need to your own project.
3. enjoy coding.
